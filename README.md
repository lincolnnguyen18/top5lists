# Setup instructions
1) Install node packages in the client and server folders; I personally run ```yarn```
2) Start react client by running ```yarn start``` in the client folder; it should automatically run on port 3000
3) Start the node server by running ```node .``` in the server folder; it should automatically run on port 3001
